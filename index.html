	<div> Rio like to snor in the living room, to lie down at most inconvinient place - here peiople need to walk. But he so cute, and I love him a lot. He like to play with a ball and love trips
	Rio is almost 7 years old. I got him at the age of 2 mounth so we together for almost 7 years  now. 
	Cause Rio is a dog, I'll put here some links about dogs of course
